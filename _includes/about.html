                    <p class="large text">I am a senior undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IITGN) majoring in mechanical engineering. During my time here, I have become interested in the field of controls and particularly its applications in robotics.</p>
					<p class="large text">Throughout my undergraduate course, I have gone through a wide variety of courses such as heat and mass transfer, fluid mechanics, dynamics and vibrations, control systems. These allowed me to simultaneously explore the various fields within mechanical engineering and narrow down on those that captured my attention. Thus, I can confidently say that I am passionate about controls and want to find out how deep this rabbit hole goes.</p>
					<p class="large text">This feeling motivated me to take up various projects related to controls. Some of these were designing a four-wheeled independently powered and steered system aiming to minimize slip or the path planning of mobile robots using a separately mounted visual system. These projects have also given me an internal perspective into the work of a control systems engineer and have reinforced my beliefs.</p>
					<p class="large text">Aside from controls, I have also tried to gain hands-on experience by attempting to build things from scratch. Hence I was motivated to begin the go-kart project and make our all-terrain vehicle to participate in the SAE eBAJA competition.</p>
					<p class="large text">However, some of the most critical life-lessons such as time management, working in groups, creativity, organizational and planning skills are some of the things that I learned outside the classroom when working on projects and assignments. I also found time to explore other, more creative, avenues such as photography and animation. Most importantly, I made some fantastic friends and peers and created memories that I will cherish forever.</p>
