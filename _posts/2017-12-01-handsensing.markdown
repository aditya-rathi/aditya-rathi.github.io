description: The handsensing project was to make a controller for pc that could send inputs based on the angle of the user’s hand. We achieved this using an arduino, processing and an accelerometer</p><p align="justify"> I worked on coding up the entire sytem. The hardware aspect was straightforward requiring minimal intervention. For the coding, I first wrote a code that would run on arduino to power the gyroscope and get angular readings from it. Then I wrote another code on processing which would allow me to read the angular data from the arduino. This data was then interpreted to send out appropriate commands. </p><p align="justify"> This project was demonstrated in ‘Ignite’ the intra-college technical festival. By mounting the arduino onto a human hand we were able to successfully play the game ‘Need for Speed’ with the arduino as the controller.
