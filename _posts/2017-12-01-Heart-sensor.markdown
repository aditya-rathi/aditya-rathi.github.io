description: The project was to create a heart-rate detector for patients with hypertension. The particular solution was devised after primary and secondary market research indicating patients with hypertension requiring a fast way to measure heart rate to prevent cardiac damage.</p><p align="justify"> Our designed product was a watch-style wearable equipped with a heart rate sensor and a touch screen. The entire system was powered using an arduino and a battery. Use of off-the-shelf components also helped to keep the price low. The product would periodically measure the patient's heart rate and notify them if the reading was too high or too low. Apart from that, it would also display messages aimed to calm the user.</p><p align="justify"> Once we made the prototype, we took it to a few users for testing. The feedback was positive overall, especially since the price point of the device was very competitive compared to commercial products. Suggested improvements for a future iteration included reducing the footprint of the device, and making it more aesthetically pleasing.
