description: For the first group, i.e. for p, div, and heading elements, the align attribute is in principle deprecated, and a document using it does not conform to a "Strict" version of HTML syntax. For the second group, i.e. for elements for table markup, it is not deprecated. (It's hard to see why. The attribute is basically presentational in both cases, and the general idea is that presentational suggestions should be made in a style sheet, not in HTML.)
